'''Classes and tools for interacting with the NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile headset.

Headset:
  Connects over bluetooth to a mac address given to it, and when asked pulls
  bytes and interpreting them per the NeuroSky/ThinkGear protocol. The
  measurements pulled are stored in a Datapoint.
Datapoint:
  Container for the attention, meditation, and brainwave measurements
  from the headset. Also handles parsing the measurements by code.

Details of the communications protocol can be found here:
  http://wearcam.org/ece516/mindset_communications_protocol.pdf
